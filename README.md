In this exercise, I used the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset  to create a dashboard application which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This application is hosted on GitHub pages at: https://vihaveman.github.io/PlotlyBiodiversityChallenge/
